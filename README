ZeroMQ-Oneliner

This module can be used to easily create ZeroMQ sockets without need to
call zmq_setsockopt, bind, connect functions. All socket options is described
in same way as http url does.

Example socket:
	
	bind-tcp://*:6666/pull?hwm=100

This means that we need to bind tcp socket on port 6666, which is ZMQ_PULL
and have high water mark set to 100.

Possible variations:
	- connection method:
		- bind
		- connect
	- connection type:
		- tcp
		- inproc
		- ipc
		- pgm
		- epgm
	- address - same as zeromq supports
	- zmq socket type:
		- push
		- pull
		- rep
		- req
		- pub
		- sub
	- options:
		- hwm
		- swap
		- identity
		- subscribe
		- rate
		- recovery
		- sndbuf
		- rcvbuf
		- linger
		- reconnect
		- backlog

CONSOLE TOOLS

There are two console tools included:
	- zmq_send wait for input on stdin and send each incoming line as separate message.
	- zmq_recv print all incoming messages into stdout.

Both called same way:
	
	zmq_send connect-tcp://127.0.0.1:6666/push

Currently only pub/sub and push/pull supported for console tools. Module support all
types.
